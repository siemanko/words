# KodeWords
This is a browser version for the board of the game "Codenames" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)).

My version is hosted at: https://takartak.github.io/kodewords
Many thanks to Szymon Sidor for developing this https://github.com/siemanko/words which is basically the core for my version.

# Game Skins
Initially I just wanted to make some front-end tweaks and add graphics and fonts to make the game pretty.
Then I decided to add some scripting for swaping css files so now there is support for game skins.

# Adding new languages
Google sheets make the job really easy. Use the following file but go through the translation manually and make sure they are good before submitting.
