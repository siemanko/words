# Words

Browser version of boardgames [codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)).

Hosted at: https://yonatanZax.github.io/words/

*Tested and works great on iPad. Double clicks are there only for non-mobile, to deal with laptop touchpads, which are often producing false-click-positives.*

# For Contributors

This is a developer-friendly version that only has ~300 lines of html. 

### Adding new languages

Google sheets make the job really easy. I will gladly accept pull request, but please go through the translation manually and make sure they are good before submitting.

### Different board sizes

There are two variables in code the describe board size and changing them should result in something that renders and plays reasonably.
